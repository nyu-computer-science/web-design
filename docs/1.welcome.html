# What to do now
## Download and install a decent code editor

A decent code editor, such as Sublime Text, is indispensible.

---

# What to do now
## Download and install a file transfer program.

In order to publish web pages, you must be able to transfer files from one computer to another on the internet.  Cyberduck is a perfectly adequate free program to do so.

https://cyberduck.io/

---

# What to do now
## Install Git for Windows

Windows users must install Git Bash, a UNIX-like command shell where we can execute UNIX commands.

https://gitforwindows.org/

OS X users already have the Terminal app we will use for this purpose.
