## Notes

I write notes for most lecture topics. You may find them useful but incomplete.

## Slides

I try to keep slides as a list of topics and points, for your future reference.

- They are, by nature, incomplete, unless I were to simply read from them like a robot.

---

## Reading

Reading assignments from [the textbook](https://knowledge.kitchen/Web_Design_Syllabus#Textbook) and elsewhere each class.

--

- The textbook is quite thorough, but not exactly necessary if you pay close attention and are willing to do some self-study.

---

--

- You lose 10 points for each day late and we do not accept submissions more than 3 days late.
