# What to do now
## Download and install a decent code editor

A decent code editor, such as Sublime Text is indispensible.

# What to do now
## Download and install a file transfer program.

You must be able to transfer files from one computer to another on the internet.  Cyberduck is a perfectly adequate free program to do so.

---

# What to do now
## Install Git for Windows

Windows users must install Git Bash, a UNIX-like command shell where we can compile and run Java programs from the command line.

https://gitforwindows.org/

OS X users already have the Terminal app we will use for this purpose.
