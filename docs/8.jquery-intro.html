## Javascript
Javascript is an interpreted programming language originally invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape.
- The first widely used web browser with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was Mosaic, created by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) - a federal/state/corporate/academic research center housed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - in 1993
- These two people then left the NCSA and started the Netscape company to create an improved successor, the Netscape browser, in 1994
- A year later, Eich's Javascript interpreter was included in the Netscape browser, along with the usual HTML interpreters (CSS didn't begin to be supported by web browsers until 1996)

## The browser war
- Microsoft released its first web browser, Internet Explorer (IE), in 1995 - based on Mosaic, which they had licensed
- IE included a clone of Netscape's Javascript Microsoft called JScript
- Microsoft had reverse-engineered Netscape's interpreter
- JScript and Javascript were almost identical, with sufficient difference to require programmers to usually write two versions of their code - one for Netscape browsers and another for IE
- Many websites of this era contained signs saying "Best viewed in Netscape" or "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" to warn users that the site was not fully cross-browser compatible
- Thus began the era of [the first browser war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) (1995 - 2001), with Internet Explorer and Netscape vying to dominate the web browser market.
- Eventually, Netscape lost the war and they released their code to the open source community
- The US government sued (and won) Microsoft in 2001 for maintaining a monopoly on web browsers primarily because it included Internet Explorer as part of the operating system.

- Browsers today are mostly compatible in how they interpret Javascript

## Neverending war
The browser wars never quite ended...
- Google's Chrome, first released in 2011, [maintains the lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_tables), with Safari in second place by market share
- Mozilla, a non-profit foundation entrusted by Netscape to maintain their source code, continues to maintain its successor, Firefox - the third most popular web browser
- Brendan Eich, inventor of Javascript, has recently created the [Brave browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)) which attempts to change the way the web is funded through ads and behavior profiling
- With many of the old-timers unhappy with the way The Web turned out, and with corporate and nation-state actors battling for control, the future direction of The Web and the browsers is still uncertain

## Javascript today
Today, the browsers are mostly compatible in how they interpret Javascript
- The capabilities of Javascript, and its use in web development, have continued to grow... it is now also used for server side logic with the Node.js interpreter.
- Internet Explorer mostly supports standard Javascript - it is still considered something of a pariah by developers.
- There remain some differences in browser implementation, but easy-to-install *frameworks*, like JQuery, easily smooth them out.
- **JQuery** provides a single set of interactive behaviors that work consistently across browsers by abstracting the code away from the browser-specific implementations.

## Event-driven programming
When we speak fo using Javascript to add interactive behaviors to web pages, we are usually referring to Javascript's ability to respond to **events**:
- clicking something on the page
- moving the mouse over something on the page
- moving the mouse off of something on the page
- pressing a key while viewing a web page
- and more...

## Types of events
We can broadly categorize events into three buckets
- Events where the user has done something (e.g. loading a page)
- Events where the browser itself has done something (e.g. clicking, typing, etc)
- Time-based events (e.g. a certain amount of time passing)

At this point you have a solid understanding of the history of Javascript.  Now on to JQuery!
