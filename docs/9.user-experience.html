# Overview

--

## Concept
**User Experience Design** (UxD), also known as Customer Experience Design (CxD), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), or Human-Centered Design, is the practice of *incorporating people's needs into the design* of the software, documents, events, activities, or other experiences.

## Assumptions

We design for people with a few assumptions in mind:

--

- **People use things for a reason**: typically a desire or need that they are trying to fulfill.

--

- **Creators have motives for making things**: often profit, esteem from peers, "keeping up-with-the-Jones's", etc.

--

- **Technologies all have constraints**: every tool has its inherent limitations that restrict what can be done with it.

## Everyone loves Venn diagrams...
... and User Experience Designers try to make all parties happy. This inevitably involves compromise.

# Requirements Gathering

--

## Concept
The first thing a UX Designer must do is establish what must be done - this is **requirements gathering**.

--

They use all resources available to them in order to determine the business goals, user needs, and technology constraints, including:

--

- **Stakeholder interviews** - speak with the important people at the organization for whom the product is being designed.

--

- **Competitive analysis** - see what the competitors are doing in this same space.

--

- **User interviews and observation** - speak with potential users and observe them while they go about doing the things your tool is intended to facilitate.

--

- **Demographic research** - review market research to understand the typical desires, problems, and needs of the average person in the demographic(s) you are targeting.

# Site Maps

--

## Concept
Site maps are diagrams intended to show the number of categories of pages that exist in a given web site and how many pages exist or must be built within each category.

---

template: site-maps

## Example
An example of a simple site map of a shoe shop web site.

template: site-maps

## Communication goals
Site maps diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- what **categories** of pages exist in a site.

--

- the number of unique design **templates** that must be created within each category.

--

- the **number of levels** of pages within each category, if a user were to *drill down* step-by-step from each category *landing page* to its children pages.

# Wireframe diagrams

--

## Concept
There are many types of specialized diagrams produced by User Experience Designers to serve different communication needs: 

--

- flow diagrams
- ecosystem maps
- user journeys
- and more...

--

For our purposes - designing and developing web pages quickly and mostly on our own - **wireframe diagrams** are the easiest to understand and produce, and provide the greatest benefit.

## Example

An example of a perfect wireframe diagram representing a web page.

---

template: wireframes

## Communication goals
Wireframe diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- what **type of content** will be on each screen.

--

- the approximate **position and size** of each piece of content.

--

- **notes** about any content or interactive behavior that is not obvious just looking at the diagram

---

template: wireframes

## Prohibitions
Wireframes, in order to best serve their purpose, should not include...

--

- **color** - everything should be black, white, and gray

--

- **design** - no shadows, fancy fonts, logos, icons or other graphics

--

- **real images** - use placeholder boxes instead where an image would go

--

- **real text** (also known as 'copy') - use '[lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)' placeholder copy instead

---

template: wireframes

## Number
Each wireframe diagram acts as a template that is then re-used for one or more screens.  Most web designers will produce distinct wireframe diagrams for at least each of the following...

--

- **home page** - these are usually unique and follow a different template from other pages.

--

- **each level of the site map** - web pages at the same depth level will generally follow the same, or similar, template - one for each level.

--

- **unique pages** - some pages are, by nature, somewhat unique in content and/or layout - for example "Contact Us" pages with *forms*, marketing *brochure-like* pages intended to give a unique look-and-feel, and others...

--

- **overlays** - any content that appears superimposed over other content when something is clicked or moused over, such as a *hamburger menu*.

# Conclusions

--

At this point you have a just enough information to get into trouble designing site maps, wireframes, and prototypes.
