# Overview

--

## Concept
**User Experience Design** (UxD), also known as Customer Experience Design (CxD), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), or Human-Centered Design, is the practice of *incorporating people's needs into the design* of the software, documents, events, activities, or other experiences.

---

template: overview

## Assumptions

We design for people with a few assumptions in mind:

--

- **People use things for a reason**: typically a desire or need that they are trying to fulfill.

--

- **Creators have motives for making things**: often profit, esteem from peers, "keeping up-with-the-Jones's", etc.

--

- **Technologies all have constraints**: every tool has its inherent limitations that restrict what can be done with it.

---

## Everyone loves Venn diagrams...
... and User Experience Designers try to make all parties happy. This inevitably involves compromise.

# Requirements Gathering

--

## Concept
The first thing a UX Designer must do is establish what must be done - this is **requirements gathering**.

--

They use all resources available to them in order to determine the business goals, user needs, and technology constraints, including:

--

- **Stakeholder interviews** - speak with the important people at the organization for whom the product is being designed.

--

- **Competitive analysis** - see what the competitors are doing in this same space.

--

- **User interviews and observation** - speak with potential users and observe them while they go about doing the things your tool is intended to facilitate.

--

- **Demographic research** - review market research to understand the typical desires, problems, and needs of the average person in the demographic(s) you are targeting.

---

template: requirements

## Deliverables
The result of requirements gathering is often one or more **requirements documents**.  These outline all that has been discovered about the project, e.g.

--

- **Business requirements** - the business goals and metrics that the project must achieve.

--

- **Technical requirements** - any rules about which technologies must be used and how they must operate.

--

- **Functional requirements** - what users must be able to do and find using the site.

--

- **Design requirements** - any particular design rules or style guides that must be followed.

--

- **Content requirements** - any particular pieces of content that must be published to the site.

# Site Maps

--

## Concept
Site maps are diagrams intended to show the number of categories of pages that exist in a given web site and how many pages exist or must be built within each category.

---

template: site-maps

## Example
An example of a simple site map of a shoe shop web site.

![Site map example](../images/ux_site_map_example.png)

---

template: site-maps

## Communication goals
Site maps diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- **the number of unique design templates** that must be created.

--

- what **categories** of pages exist in a site.

--

- the **number of levels** of pages within each category, if a user were to *drill down* step-by-step from each category *landing page* to its children pages.

---

template: site-maps

## Prohibitions
Site maps, in order to best serve their purpose, should not...

--

- indicate more pages than you are capable of developing, filling with content, and maintaining - **make a plan that is achievable**.

--

- attempt to show every link from every page to every other page - **draw lines for parent-to-child relationships only**

--

- have more levels than absolutely necessary - **err on the side of fewer levels**.

--

- have more categories than necessary - **err on the side of fewer categories**.

# Wireframe diagrams

--

## Concept
There are many types of specialized diagrams and documents produced by User Experience Designers to serve different communication needs: 

--

- flow diagrams
- ecosystem maps
- user journeys
- content audits
- information taxonomies
- and more...

--

For our purposes - designing and developing web pages quickly and mostly on our own - **wireframe diagrams** are the easiest to understand and produce, and provide the greatest benefit.

## Example

---

template: wireframes

## Communication goals
Wireframe diagrams are simple, fast, easy-to-draw diagrams that communicate...

--

- what **type of content** will be on each screen.

--

- the approximate **position and size** of each piece of content.

--

- **notes** about any content or interactive behavior that is not obvious just looking at the diagram

---

template: wireframes

## Prohibitions
Wireframes, in order to best serve their purpose, should not include...

--

- **color** - everything should be black, white, and gray

--

- **design** - no shadows, fancy fonts, logos, icons or other graphics

--

- **real images** - use placeholder boxes instead where an image would go

--

- **real text** (also known as 'copy') - use '[lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)' placeholder copy instead

---

template: wireframes

## Number
Each wireframe diagram acts as a template that is then re-used for one or more screens.  Most web designers will produce distinct wireframe diagrams for at least each of the following...

--

- **home page** - these are usually unique and follow a different template from other pages.

--

- **each level of the site map** - web pages at the same depth level will generally follow the same, or similar, template - one for each level.

--

- **unique pages** - some pages are, by nature, somewhat unique in content and/or layout - for example "Contact Us" pages with *forms*, marketing *brochure-like* pages intended to give a unique look-and-feel, and others...

--

- **overlays** - any content that appears superimposed over other content when something is clicked or moused over, such as a *hamburger menu*.

## Our choice
Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to build your wireframes and site map.
- no frills
- no cost
- perfect for a small site

# Prototyping

--

## Concept
Once initial wireframe diagrams have been drafted, it's easy to put together a **clickable prototype** of a web site using those wireframes.  Benefits of a building a prototype include...

--

- for stakeholders to all agree that this is **how the website will function**.

--

- to **count how many clicks or taps** it might take for a user to get to the content that interests them.

--

- to **show to potential end-users** to get their feedback.

--

- to **do a sanity check** before spending time and effort building the site.

---

--

- [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/) - free trial available

--

- [Adobe XD](https://adobe.com/xd) - limited free version available

--

- [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) - free trial available

---

## Our choice
Use [InvisionApp](https://invision.com) to build your clickable prototypes.
- something of an industry standard today
- easy to use
- 1 free prototype is all we need

---

template: prototyping

## Requirements
When creating a clickable prototype, meet the following minimal requirements:

--

- all buttons, links or other user interface components that allow a user to navigate from one page to another must be functional in the prototype

--

- create as many variations of your existing wireframe diagrams as you need in order to make the prototype look "believable"; give a real sense of how the application flow might work... don't take shortcuts.

--

- your prototypes must be designed to clearly show the way in which a user navigates from one page to another, as well as how they solve the core use cases and needs your web site is designed to solve.

# Conclusions

--

At this point you have a just enough information to get into trouble designing site maps, wireframes, and building clickable prototypes.  Go for it!
