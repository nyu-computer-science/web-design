# Overview

template: overview
name: overview-1

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to indicate the visual presentation of the content on a web page.
- What color(s) each element should be
- What font should be used
- The position of each element on the page
- The spacing between elements
- etc

# Separation of Concerns

template: separation
name: separation-1

The **separation of concerns** is a philosophy popular in technology that different tasks should be accomplished by different technologis.  With regards the Web:
- The semantic content should be controlled by Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- The visual presentation of content should be controlled by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- The interactive behavior of content should be controlled by Javascript (JS)

# Selectors

---

template: selectors
name: selectors-1

## Concept
Out of all the elements on a page, a selector picks those that will be styled by a given block of code.

For example, the following code selects for any and all `p` paragraph elements on the page and gives them a blue font color.  
- The `p` is the 'selector', `color: blue;` is a 'rule'.

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

---

template: selectors
name: selectors-2

## Selecting by tag name
Selectors can select by tag name:

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

```css
img {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

name: selectors-3

## Selecting by id attribute
Selectors can select by a *unique* identifier optionally given to a particular element:
- HTML `id` attribute values must be unique - no two elements can share the same `id` value.

For example, given the following HTML code:
```html
<img id="donkey" src="images/donkey.jpg" />
```

---

template: selectors
name: selectors-3a

## Selecting by id attribute (continued)

The following CSS code would select for just this one `donkey` image.
```css
img#donkey {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

This can be rewritten to select for an element of any type with the id `donkey`.
```css
#donkey {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

name: selectors-4

## Selecting by class attribute
Selectors can select by a *non-unique* `class` optionally given to a particular element:
- HTML `class` attribute values *need not be unique*, but they can be if applied to only one element.

For example, given the following HTML code:
```html
<ul>
    <li class="odd">Tomatoes</li>
    <li class="even">Bananas</li>
    <li class="odd">Yuccas</li>
    <li class="even">Beets</li>
</ul>
```

---

template: selectors
name: selectors-4a

## Selecting by class attribute (continued)

The following CSS code would select for only the `even` list items.
```css
li.even {
    background-color: pink;
}
```

This can be rewritten to select for elements of any type with the class `even`.
```css
.even {
    background-color: pink;
}
```

# Rules

---

template: rules
name: rules-1

## Concept
Rules are changes to a style property, applied to whichever element(s) have been selected.
- Each rule indicates the name of a property to be changed, and the new value to assign to it.

For example, the following CSS code contains three rules necessary to control the border of an element.
```css
header {
    /* the following three lines are rules */
    border-width: 1px;
    border-color: black;
    border-style: solid;
}

```

---

template: rules
name: rules-2

## Changing color
There are several properties related to color changes, including:
- `color` - the text color applied to text within the selected element(s)
- `background-color` - background color applied to the entire area of the selected element(s)
- `border-color` - the color of any border applied to the selected element(s)
```

Example:
```css
footer {
    color: black;
    background-color: #c0c0c0;
    border-color: blue;
    /* the other two border-related properties are necessary to show a border */
    border-width: 2px;
    border-style: dotted;
}
```

## Changing text
There are several properties related to text or font changes, including:
- `color` - the text color applied to text within the selected element(s)
- `font-family` - the font to be used for any text within the selected element(s)
- `font-size` - the size of the text can be specified in a variety of units (pt, px, etc)
- `text-decoration` - used to apply any `underline` or `overline` to the selected text
- `font-weight` - whether text is `bold`, `normal`, or `light`
```

Example:
```css
p#first {
    color: purple;
    font-family: helvetica;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

---

template: rules
name: rules-4

## Changing sizing and spacing
There are a few properties related to text or font changes, including:
- `width` - the width of an element
- `height` - the height of an element
- `margin` - the spacing *external* to an element
- `padding` - the spacing *internal* to an element
```

Example:
```css
aside {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 400px;
    height: 600px; /* as a general rule, don't set the height of an element like this... let the height auto-adjust to fit the content within the element */
}
```

## Compound selectors

The following will apply the same set of rules to both `header` and `footer` elements:
- Note the use of the comma - `,`.

```css
header, footer {
    background-color: #00ff00;
}
```

Here's another example with a mix of different kinds of selectors:
```css
section#first, aside.nonesense, p {
    background-color: #00ff00;
}
```

---

template: more-selectors
name: more-selectors-2

## Nesting selectors

The following will apply the rules to any `p` paragraph element within an `article` element.
- Note the use of the space.
- Note that `article` elements do not have their styles changed by this.

```css
article p {
    background-color: #00ff00;
}
```

Another example with a mix of different selector types:
```css
article#featured p.green {
    background-color: #00ff00;
}
```

---

template: more-selectors
name: more-selectors-3

## Direct descendent selectors

Given the following HTML code:
```html
<article class="featured">
    <h2>Something Important</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet....</p>
    <aside>
        <h3>A Side Note</h3>
        <p>Twas brillig and the slithy toves...</p>
    </aside>
</article>
```

---

template: more-selectors
name: more-selectors-3a

## Direct descendent selectors (continued)

The following CSS selector would only select the `p` paragraph that is nested directly within the `article`, not the other.
- Note the use of the greater than sign, `>`.

```css
article.featured > p {
    background-color: #00ff00;
}
```
