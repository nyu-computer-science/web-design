# The Internet

---

template: internet
name: internet-1

## Definition
The Internet is the global interconnected network of computers that communicate via a set of standardized protocols.

---

template: internet-1
name: internet-2

- It is sometimes referred to as a "network of networks."

---

template: internet
name: internet-3

## Connective tissue
The vast expanses of the Internet's reach are today enabled primarily by fiber optic cables that run locally, regionally, and across ocean floors to connect continents.

Copper wires and radio signals account for a smaller fraction of the total distance traveled by data on the Internet.

## Origins
The Internet evolved over decades, funded primarily by the US Department of Defense
- US Department of Defense networking projects in the 1960s explored fault-tolerant networks resistent to nuclear attack
- The ARPANET, a mostly regional network in the 1970s-80s, attempted to improve interoperability among different computer systems
- transitioned to the Internet in 1980s-90s, a global network of interoperable computers

## Ownership
The "backbone" of networking equipment "that fuels the Internet belongs to a patchwork of different interests:
- telecommunications companies and other private corporations
- federal, state, and local government
- academia
- military

Most organizations providing key parts of the internet backbone abide by a "free peering" agreement, whereby they agree to relay eaach others' data across their own network hardware for free.

## Control
The Internet, where anyone anywhere can share information, steal information, surveil and influence populations on the other side of the globe, is increasingly the site of a struggle for information dominance.

---

template: internet-5
name: internet-6

- A decade or two ago, many saw the Internet as a democratizing force for peoples everywhere.

---

template: internet-6
name: internet-7

- Today, some predict a future of multiple Internets run by competing nation states.

# The World Wide Web

---

template: web
name: web-1

## Definition
The World Wide Web is one use of the Internet to publish and browse hypertext documents.

---

template: web
name: web-2

## Hypertext
- "hypertext" means documents which reference and link to one-another.

---

template: web-2
name: web-3

- The hypertext concept was first popularized by Dr. Vannevar Bush in a 1945 article in The Atlantic titled, "[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)".

---

- Vannevar Bush was then the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the US military.

---

name: web-5

- After World War II, where he managed miliatry scientific research including the development of the atomic bomb, Bush turned his sights to the problem of information overload.

---

## Origin
- The World Wide Web was invented in 1989-1990 by a British researcher at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee.

---

template: web-6
name: web-7

- Berners-Lee acknowledged that his invention was really a mashup of existing concepts, including hypertext, the Internet, and multi-font text.

---

template: web-7
name: web-8

- Inventing The Web required him to think at a higher level of abstraction and generalization to envision the value of this combination.

---

template: web-8
name: web-9

- He then invented Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and created the first web browser, the first web server, and invented the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate with a specific set of commands.

# Clients and servers

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-1

## Definitions
- a **client** is any machine on a network that is requesting data from a *server*.

---

template: clients-servers-1
name: clients-servers-2

- a **server** is any machine that is responding to a request for data from a *client* machine.

---

template: clients-servers-2
name: clients-servers-3

- a single machine may sometimes act the role of a client in one interaction and the role of a server in another.

---

name: http

# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

---

template: http
name: http-1

## Standardized requests and responses
The HTTP specification indicates 
- how Web clients can make requests to Web servers
- how Web servers can respond to those requests from Web clients

---

template: http
name: http-2

## Plain text
HTTP request and response commands are sent as plain text over the network, following a specific format.
- for added security, the **HTTPS** "secure" extension of HTTP encrypts the request and response communication while in transit

---

template: http
name: http-3

## Request types
The two most widely used [request types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) allowed by the HTTP specification
- **GET** - a web client requests that the web server respond by giving it a specific information resource, such as a web page
- **POST** - a web client supplies some data to the web server along with the request with the intention that the server save that data, or at least use it to changee its behavior in some way

---

template: http
name: http-4

## Response codes
Web server responses include a [status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), indicating the status of the client's request.
- **200** to **299**: success
- **400** to **499**: client error
- **500** to **599**: server error
- and more...

## Example of a web client GET request
```http
GET /Web_Design_Schedule HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: knowledge.kitchen
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

## Example of a successsful web server response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2022 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html

# Back-End Technologies

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-1

## Overview
Back-end technologies are used to program the behavior of the web server and how it responds to various kinds of client requests.

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-2

## Common back-end technology stacks
- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (the LAMP stack)
- MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (the MERN stack)
- MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js (the MEAN stack)
