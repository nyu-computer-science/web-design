# The Internet

---

template: internet
name: internet-1

## Definition
The Internet is the global interconnected network of computers that communicate via a set of standardized protocols.

---

template: internet-1
name: internet-2

- It is sometimes referred to as a "network of networks."

---

template: internet
name: internet-3

## Connective tissue
The vast expanses of the Internet's reach are today enabled primarily by fiber optic cables that run locally, regionally, and across ocean floors to connect continents.

Copper wires and radio signals account for a smaller fraction of the total distance traveled by data on the Internet.

## Origins
The Internet evolved over decades, funded primarily by the US Department of Defense
- US Department of Defense networking projects in the 1960s explored fault-tolerant networks resistent to nuclear attack
- The ARPANET, a mostly regional network in the 1970s-80s, attempted to improve interoperability among different computer systems
- transitioned to the Internet in 1980s-90s, a global network of interoperable computers

## Ownership
The "backbone" of networking equipment that fuels the Internet belongs to a patchwork of different interests:
- telecommunications companies and other private corporations
- federal, state, and local government
- academia
- military

## Cooperation
Given the patchwork of operators controlling different parts, cooperation is key.
- Organizations of approximately equal size that provide key parts of the Internet backbone usually abide by a "free peering" agreement, whereby they agree to relay each others' data across their own network hardware for free.
- Organizations of different sizes who need to cooperate often work out payment agreements to let traffic from one travel over the other's equipment

## Control
The Internet, where anyone anywhere can share information, steal information, surveil and influence populations on the other side of the globe, is increasingly the site of a struggle for information dominance.

---

- A decade or two ago, many saw the Internet as a [democratizing force](https://blogs.harvard.edu/idblog/2008/05/14/the-democratic-power-shift-on-the-internet/) for peoples everywhere.

- Today, some point out a [more complicated situation](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Siegel-t.html) where information and access to that information is controlled by corporate and government interests.

# The World Wide Web

---

template: web
name: web-1

## Definition
The World Wide Web is one use of the Internet to publish and browse hypertext documents.

---

template: web
name: web-2

## Hypertext
- "hypertext" means documents which reference and link to one-another.

---

template: web-2
name: web-3

- The hypertext concept was first popularized by Dr. Vannevar Bush in a 1945 article in The Atlantic titled, "[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)".

---

template: web-3
name: web-4

- Vannevar Bush was then the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the US military.

---

template: web-4
name: web-5

- After World War II, where he managed miliatry scientific research including the development of the atomic bomb, Bush turned his sights on the problem of information overload.

---

## Origin
- The World Wide Web was invented in 1989-1990 by a British researcher at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee.

---

template: web-6
name: web-7

- Berners-Lee acknowledged that his invention was really a mashup of existing concepts, including hypertext, the Internet, and multi-font text.

---

template: web-7
name: web-8

- Inventing The Web required him to think at a higher level of abstraction and generalization to envision the value of this combination.

---

template: web-8
name: web-9

- He then invented Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and created the first web browser, the first web server, and invented the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate with a specific set of commands.

# Clients and servers

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-1

## Definitions
- a **client** is any machine on a network that is requesting data from a *server*.

---

template: clients-servers-1
name: clients-servers-2

- a **server** is any machine that is responding to a request for data from a *client* machine.

---

template: clients-servers-2
name: clients-servers-3

- a single machine may sometimes act the role of a client in one interaction and the role of a server in another.

---

template: clients-servers-3
name: clients-servers-4

- the terms *client* or *server* can also be used to refer to the specific software on the client or server machine that is handling the communication in question.

---

name: http

# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

---

template: http
name: http-1

## Standardized requests and responses
The HTTP specification indicates 
- how Web clients can make requests to Web servers
- how Web servers can respond to those requests from Web clients

---

template: http
name: http-2

## Plain text
HTTP request and response commands are sent as plain text over the network, following a specific format.
- for added security, the **HTTPS** "secure" extension of HTTP encrypts the request and response communication while in transit

---

template: http
name: http-3

## Request types
The two most widely used [request types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) allowed by the HTTP specification
- **GET** - a web client requests that the web server respond by giving it a specific information resource, such as a web page
- **POST** - a web client supplies some data to the web server along with the request with the intention that the server save that data, or at least use it to changee its behavior in some way

---

template: http-3
name: http-4

- other HTTP request types do exist, but are less widely used.

---

template: http
name: http-5

## Response codes
Web server responses include a [status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), indicating the success or failure of the client's request.
- **200** to **299**: success
- **400** to **499**: client error
- **500** to **599**: server error
- and more...

## Example of a web client GET request
```http
GET /some_document.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: knowledge.kitchen
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
```

## Example of a web client POST request
```http
POST /some_document.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: knowledge.kitchen
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 40
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

# Front-End Technologies

---

template: front-end

## Overview
Front-end technologies are those languages or programs which are interpreted and executed by the client, usually a web browser.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-1

## HTML
Used to indicate the content and semantic meaning of content on a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-2

## CSS
Used to indicate the style and presentation of a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-3

## Javascript
Used to indicate interaative behaviors of a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-4

## Frameworks
Front-end frameworks attempt to simplify and streamline the process of creating front-end interfaces.
* Bootstrap - a framework originally by Twitter with readymade CSS and Javascript code that handles many common interface design needs
* React - a framework by Facebook that attempts to abstract and streamline the process of generating the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for a web or mobile app; allows for easy sharing among projects of modular "components" and behaviors
* Angular - a competitor to React
* Material UI - a competitor to Bootstrap by Google, specifically design to modularly fit into any project using React

template: back-end
name: back-end-1

## Overview
Back-end technologies are those languages or programs used to control the behavior of the web server and how it responds to various kinds of client requests.

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-2

## Popular back-end programaming languages
- PHP, sometimes with framework such as Laravel or Sympfony
- Node.js Javascript, often with the Express framework
- Ruby, often with the Rails framework
- Python, often with the Django or Flask frameworks
- C#, with the .NET framework
- ASP, with the .NET framework
